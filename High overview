1. Source Components and Initial Trigger:

S3 source bucket for PDF uploads
S3 event trigger on PDF upload
IAM role for Lambda with necessary permissions


2. Processing Components:

Lambda function that will:

Read the PDF text content
Interface with Amazon Polly to convert text to speech
Save the resulting MP3 to destination bucket


Amazon Polly configuration for text-to-speech conversion


3. Destination and Notification:

S3 destination bucket for MP3 files
S3 event trigger on MP3 creation
SNS topic for email notifications
IAM permissions for S3 to publish to SNS


4. Data Flow:

User uploads PDF to source bucket
Upload triggers Lambda function
Lambda reads PDF and extracts text
Lambda calls Polly to convert text to speech
Lambda saves MP3 to destination bucket
MP3 creation triggers SNS notification
User receives email with direct link to MP3


5. Key Considerations:

PDF text extraction method
Polly voice selection and language settings
MP3 file naming convention
S3 presigned URL generation for the email link
Error handling and retry mechanisms
Lambda timeout settings (for large documents)
